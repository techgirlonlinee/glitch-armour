    description: `Messaging apps are the intimate threads connecting you to friends, family, and communities. Instagram Messenger isn't end-to-end encrypted, exposing conversations to Meta's data collection. Flip phones don't escape surveillance—cell networks still track your location and communication patterns. Even "encrypted" apps like WhatsApp and iMessage collect metadata about who, when, and where you chat. Surveillance chic. 
A privacy-focused messenger is like a soundproof room with no windows, where conversations happen without leaving a trace.`  },

It's a prime tracking territory for corporations to build comprehensive profiles of your digital existence for every click, site visit, and search. A privacy-focused browser is a tool that creates a secure, encrypted environment that basically says nope to tracking, blocks sketchy scripts, and limits digital surveillance. It's basically your personal privacy knight of the online window.`},

It's surveillance capitalism: less about reading your mail, more about surveilling your entire life.`
